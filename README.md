# LibraryProject
The aim of the work was to create an application supporting the library service by providing employees with the option of searching, browsing, editing, deleting, as well as borrowing and returning books, and customers with the option of searching, browsing and booking selected titles. Each user can also scan the title of the book using the camera on the phone.
